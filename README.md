# CT_React_demo
This demo integrates the CT React SDK with custom initialization triggered upon user login. When the user clicks the login button, the SDK is initialized and the user is identified. This approach helps prevent the creation of anonymous users, effectively reducing Monthly Active Users (MAU) count.
